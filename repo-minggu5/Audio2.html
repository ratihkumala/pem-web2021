        <p>
            I wonder if I'm being <br><br>
            Do I speak my truth or do I filter how I feel?<br><br>
            I wonder, wouldn't it be nice<br><br>
            To live inside a world that isn't black and white?<br><br>
            I wonder what it's like to be my friends<br><br>
            Hope that they don't think I forget about them<br><br>
            I wonder, I wonder<br><br>
            Right before I close my eyes<br><br>
            The only thing that's on my mind<br><br>
            Been dreaming that you feel it, too<br><br>           
            I wonder what it's like to be loved by you, yeah<br><br>
            I wonder what it's like<br><br>            
            I wonder what it's like to be loved by<br><br>            
            I wonder why I'm so afraid<br><br>            
            Of saying something wrong, I never said I was a saint<br><br>            
            I wonder, when I cry into my hands<br><br>            
            I'm conditioned to feel like it makes me less of a man<br><br>            
            And I wonder if some day you'll be by my side<br><br>            
            And tell me that the world will end up alright<br><br>            
            I wonder, I wonder<br><br>            
            Right before I close my eyes<br><br>            
            The only thing that's on my mind<br><br>            
            Been dreaming that you feel it, too<br><br>            
            I wonder what it's like to be loved by you, yeah<br><br>            
            I wonder what it's like<br><br>            
            I wonder what it's like to be loved by you<br><br>            
            I wonder what it's like to be loved by you, yeah<br><br>            
            I wonder what it's like to be loved by you<br><br>            
            I wonder what it's like to be loved by<br><br>            
            Right before I close my eyes<br><br>            
            The only thing that's on my mind<br><br>
            Been dreaming that you feel it too<br><br>            
            I wonder what it's like to be loved by you<br><br>
